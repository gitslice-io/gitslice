# Gitslice Execution Log

This log captures implementation notes, decisions, and important learnings while
turning the design docs into the first Go prototype.

## 2026-05-22: Start Go Prototype

Request:

- start implementing the MVP
- keep implementation in Go
- use one server binary and one CLI binary
- use a fake account service and all core gRPC services in the same server
- use real PostgreSQL
- use filesystem object storage only for the prototype
- keep `server/` wiring-only and put service behavior under `service/`

Initial repo state:

- repository only contained design docs and no Go module
- current branch: `codex/single-slice-workspaces`
- open PR: #6
- untracked `.antigravitycli/` is unrelated and should remain untouched

Implementation decision:

- create a new Go module in this repo
- add `cmd/gitslice-server` for the server binary
- add `cmd/gs` for the CLI binary
- add top-level `server/` for process wiring only
- add top-level `service/` for fake account and core gRPC implementations
- add `proto/core/v1` with hand-written gRPC bindings for the prototype so the
  repo can compile without adding a proto generation step yet
- use a JSON gRPC codec for the prototype service boundary; this keeps the first
  pass focused on service behavior and CLI/server integration
- add PostgreSQL-backed metadata storage and migrations
- add filesystem object-store package for prototype blob/object bytes

Implemented in the first pass:

- created the Go module and dependency set for gRPC and PostgreSQL
- added hand-written `proto/core/v1` service bindings and JSON-encoded message
  structs for the prototype
- added `cmd/gitslice-server` and `cmd/gs`
- added `server/` with config loading, gRPC listener setup, auth interceptor,
  health service registration, migration startup, and dependency wiring only
- added top-level `service/` implementing fake account login plus repository,
  blob, slice, workspace, and changeset gRPC services
- added `internal/postgres` with migrations, development fixture seeding, fake
  sessions, accounts, slices, refs, commits, commit file snapshots, blobs,
  changesets, and patchsets
- added `internal/objectstore/filesystem` as the prototype content-addressed byte
  store
- added `internal/objectid`, `internal/paths`, and `internal/authctx` helpers
- added the minimal CLI journey:
  - `gs auth login`
  - `gs workspace init acme/payment`
  - `gs status`
  - `gs cs create`
  - `gs cs submit`
  - `gs cs status`
- added a functional smoke test that starts the real server and runs the CLI
  against it when `GITSLICE_TEST_DATABASE_URL` points at a disposable PostgreSQL
  database

Important implementation decisions and learnings:

- The filesystem object store is only a prototype adapter. PostgreSQL is already
  the source of truth for object metadata and reachability.
- The first schema includes `commit_files` so submit can create a real file
  snapshot instead of moving a ref without corresponding file state.
- Workspace metadata starts as JSON files under `.gs/` (`slice.json` and
  `state.json`) instead of YAML. This avoids adding another parser dependency
  before the CLI shape stabilizes and gives tests deterministic fixtures.
- The hand-written gRPC package is a bootstrapping shortcut. A generated proto
  step should replace it once the API stabilizes.
- The first real smoke run found that the hand-written gRPC unary helper was not
  populating `grpc.UnaryServerInfo.FullMethod`, which caused the auth
  interceptor to treat `FakeAccountService.Login` as protected. The binding now
  passes canonical full method names to the interceptor.
- `go test ./...` passes without a local database by skipping the real-Postgres
  functional smoke test. Running that smoke requires `GITSLICE_TEST_DATABASE_URL`.
- Verified the functional smoke against local PostgreSQL with:

```bash
GITSLICE_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://nic@localhost/gitslice_dev?sslmode=disable go test -count=1 ./tests/functional -run TestMinimalCLIJourney -v
```
